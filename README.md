This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# User Stories

---

1. As a user I want to sign up for flicks using my Gmail account so that I don't have to manage another set of login credentials.
2. As an authorized user I want a main page where I can view both my watch list and recommendation list side-by-side so it limits the amount of navigation that has to be done.
3. As an authorized user, I want a button right next to each movie or show that automatically sends a 'thank you' to the other user who recommended it so I don't have to navigate to their page, or write a personalized note.
4. As I user, I want my watch list and my recommendation list to have a sorting option based off genre, streaming service, and who recommended the show or movie so I can find the exact show or movie I may be in the mood for.
5. As an authorized user, I want a button above each movie or show that allows me to send a recommendation to my friends from any screen of the app where a movie or film is listed (search screen, my lists, another user's list), so I don't run the risk of forgetting about it, or needing to search for it again elsewhere.
6. As a user, I want any page that contains a movie or show listed as a movie poster to have a mouseover option that contains pertinent information, such as the specific streaming service it is available on, as well as the title, and year of release so I don't later have to search for those titles on a different page.
7. As a user, I want a page that will display more details about a title when I click on that particular title, such as a brief description and a rating (from RottenTomatoes or IMDB) so I can remain on the flicks site when needing to gain more information on a title.
8. As a user, I want a consistent navigation bar on every page that will direct me to my lists and hosts a search bar for titles so I don't have to re-learn a new page every time I click to a new location.
9. As a user, I want a notification, similar to a red facebook notification, that will let me know when I have received a new recommendation from someone so I don't lose track.
10. As a user, I want a feature on my main page that will allow me to either accept or reject new recommendations from being added to my list, so I can manage my list to match what I want.
11. As a user, I want the capability to add separate lists based off of my own desires (wanting to add a "Halloween List" or a "Date Night" list) so I can customize the page to my needs.
